abstract="In this work we present a convolutional neural network-based algorithm for recognition of hand postures on images acquired by a single color camera. The hand is extracted in advance on the basis of skin color distribution. A neural network-based regressor is applied to locate the wrist. Finally, a convolutional neural network trained on 6000 manually labeled images representing ten classes is executed to recognize the hand posture in a sub-window determined on the basis of the wrist. We show that our model achieves high classification accuracy, including scenarios with different camera used in testing. We show that the convolutional network achieves better results on images pre-filtered by a Gabor filter.",

        abstract = {Sign language is used by approximately 70 million1 people throughout the world, and an automatic tool for interpreting it could make a major impact on communication between those who use it and those who may not understand it.
However, computer interpretation of sign language is very difficult given the variability in size, shape and position of the fingers or hands in an image.
Hence, this paper explores the applicability of deep learning for interpreting sign language. The paper develops a convolutional neural network aimed at classifying fingerspelling images using both image intensity and depth data.
The developed convolutional network is evaluated by applying it to the problem of finger spelling recognition for American Sign Language. The evaluation shows that the developed convolutional network performs better than previous studies and has precision of 82\% and recall of 80\%. Analysis of the confusion matrix from the evaluation reveals the underlying difficulties of classifying some particular signs which is discussed in the paper.}
